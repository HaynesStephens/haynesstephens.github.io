**Hello!** 😄

I am a **Researcher** at the University of Chicago in the Department of Geophysical Sciences. My PhD thesis focuses on using machine learning and data science techniques to better understand the potential impacts of climate change on U.S. agriculture.

I am also a graduate student researcher at [The Center for Robust Decision-making on Climate and Energy Policy](http://www.rdcep.org/), currently working to understand the historical evolution of the U.S. energy system and takeaways for future planning.

### career interests

I am looking to apply my technical skills to decarbonization efforts that can create a greener society. 🌿<br>
I am also an advocate for engaging more scientists in climate-energy policy, as policy approaches to climate change will inherently require science-based solutions.
