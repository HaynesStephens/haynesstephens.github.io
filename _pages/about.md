**Hello!** 

I am a **Researcher** at the University of Chicago in the Department of Geophysical Sciences. I use original machine learning models and data science to understand the impacts of climate change on U.S. agriculture, working with large datasets from observational records and model output.

I am also a graduate student researcher at [The Center for Robust Decision-making on Climate and Energy Policy](http://www.rdcep.org/), currently working to unveil the history of U.S. energy infrastructure and lessons for the future.

### research interests

I am looking to apply my technical research skills toward decarbonization projects, with a growing research passion toward optimizing the energy sector ‚Äì lately I've been interested in ***grid-enhancing technologies*** and ***virtual power plants*** using artificial intelligence.
