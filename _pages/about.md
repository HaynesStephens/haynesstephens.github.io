**Hello!** 

I am a **Researcher** at the University of Chicago in the Department of Geophysical Sciences. My PhD thesis focuses on modeling the effects of environmental factors on U.S. agricultural production, improving our understanding of future climate change impacts.

I am also a graduate student researcher at [The Center for Robust Decision-making on Climate and Energy Policy](http://www.rdcep.org/), currently working to understand the historicala evolution of the U.S. energy system and takeaways for future planning.

### career interests

I am looking to apply my technical research skills toward decarbonization projects. Lately I've been interested in using artifical intelligence through ***grid-enhancing technologies*** and ***virtual power plants*** to create a cleaner energy sector. I am also an advocate for engaging more scientists in climate-energy policy, as policy approaches to climate change will inherently require science-based solutions.
